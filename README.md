# MMRA
Our benchmark dataset is released: [Huggingface Dataset: m-a-p/MMRA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/MMRA), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XhyCfCM6McC_umSEQJ4NvCZGMUnMdzj2/view?usp=sharing).

The MMRA.zip in Google Drive contains a metadata.json file, which includes all the sample information. We can input the relevant questions, options, and image pairs to LVMLs through it.
